🧹 Data Preparation for Customer Segmentation
This project focuses on the initial data preparation stage for segmenting customers, conducted as part of my mentorship program. The aim is to clean and transform the online retail dataset, enabling effective clustering analysis.

📌 Purpose
The main goal is to preprocess the retail dataset to make it ready for unsupervised machine learning methods such as K-means clustering. This process covers several key steps:

Importing the data

Conducting exploratory data analysis

Handling missing values and erroneous records

Creating relevant features

Applying necessary data transformations (like normalization or scaling)

Storing the processed dataset for subsequent modeling

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
Python programming language

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical computations

Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
